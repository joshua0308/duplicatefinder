# DupllicateFinder
DuplicateFinder is a Google Sheet Add-on that allows users to find and remove duplicates with a single click.

After successfully downloading DuplicateFinder, click on the Add-ons option to enable DuplicateFinder. Then, select the data that you want to check for duplicates and click the DuplicateFinder on the top of the sheet. DuplicateFinder provides you with two options. You can either 'Find duplicates' or 'Remove duplicates'. 'Find duplicates' will find the duplicates from the selected cells and highlight them in yellow. 'Remove duplicates' will find the duplicates and remove them from the current sheet. Removed duplicates will be saved on a new sheet to make sure you don't lose any of your data.
